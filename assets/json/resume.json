Before I worked with he directly, I was aware of his excellent reputation through the university – someone that everyone knows, and feels that they can approach for help, advice and guidance. Zhiyu is one of those people in an organisation that will help galvanise a project with enthusiasm, humour and talent – which is infections across the team and the organisation. Its been a joy to work with him, both in terms of being a technologist and a professional. I look forward very much to the opportunity to work with Zhiyu again."
