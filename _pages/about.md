ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m thrilled youâ€™re here. Hereâ€™s a snapshot of my journey so far:

#### Current
Iâ€™m an MPhil candidate in Advanced Computer Science at [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), where Iâ€™m developing **topological neural network** architectures for protein structure representation under the supervision of [Prof. Pietro LiÃ²](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4YhNJBEAAAAJ&hl=en).

#### Background
I graduated with First-Class Honours in BSc Computer Science from [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). During my time there, I:

- Built an **ML-based remote patient monitoring** system under the supervision of [Prof. Ivana Drobnjak](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=55BI2VIICu8C&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
- Interned as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Xunfei Healthcare](https://www.xunfeihealthcare.com/en/about.html), where I designed a framework to generate synthetic datasets for healthcare **LLM instruction-tuning**.

#### Research Interests
My passion lies at the crossroads of **geometric deep learning** and **large language models**. Iâ€™m dedicated to creating novel ML methods that address pressing biomedical and healthcare challenges. I welcome opportunities to collaborate on innovative, high-impact projects!
